Credit Underwriting: A Feature-Driven, Behavioral
Perspective

Introduction
When people talk about “underwriting models,” they often imagine black-box machine learning
systems. In practice, strong underwriting is far less about exotic algorithms and far more about
choosing the right features, understanding what they imply about human behavior,
and deploying models that can evolve as customer behavior evolves.
The objective is not to perfectly predict default. The objective is to:
• control early risk,
• learn rapidly from behavior,
• expand access safely for thin-file customers, and
• prevent non-performing loans before they form.
This document explains the underwriting feature set in a narrative, example-driven way so
that it can be quickly grasped without technical deep dives.
We divide features into:
1. Easily available features (“low-hanging fruits”)
2. Features that require future partnerships (covered in Part II)

1. Easily Available Features (Low-Hanging Fruits)
These features rely primarily on transactional visibility, card usage data, and basic digital
signals. On their own, they are sufficient to build a strong first underwriting engine, especially
for customers with limited credit bureau history.

A. Transaction Behavior: The Most Honest Data
Transaction behavior reflects revealed preferences rather than self-reported information. It is
often more reliable than declared income or demographic attributes.

1

1. Spend Regularity
Definition: The consistency of a customer’s total spending over time.
Example:
• Customer A spends OMR 200–250 every month.
• Customer B spends OMR 50 one month, OMR 700 the next, and nothing the month after.
Interpretation:
• High regularity indicates stable cash flow.
• High volatility indicates liquidity stress or income uncertainty.
In practice, spend regularity is often more predictive of short-term default risk than income
level itself.
2. Spend Frequency vs Ticket Size
Definition: The balance between many small transactions and a few large transactions.
Example:
• Frequent groceries, fuel, and food purchases.
• Rare but very large electronics or travel purchases.
Interpretation:
• Frequent small transactions reflect lifestyle spending and self-regulation.
• Large, infrequent transactions are more sensitive to income shocks.
3. Merchant Diversity Index
Definition: The number and variety of merchant categories a customer transacts with.
Example:
• Narrow diversity: only food delivery and ride-hailing.
• Broad diversity: groceries, utilities, healthcare, retail, dining.
Interpretation:
• Broad diversity suggests integration into the daily economy.
• Narrow diversity may indicate situational or lifestyle dependence.
This is a powerful alternative data signal that works even when credit bureau data is thin.

4. Essential vs Discretionary Spend Ratio
Definition: The proportion of spending on necessities versus optional categories.
Interpretation:
• Some discretionary spending indicates comfort and flexibility.
• Extremely high discretionary spend relative to income signals risk.
• Extremely low discretionary spend indicates vulnerability to shocks.
Healthy borrowers typically exhibit a balanced mix rather than extremes.

B. Payment Behavior: Early Warning Signals
Payment behavior often changes before delinquency appears. These features are critical for
proactive risk control.
5. Payment Timing Drift
Definition: Changes in how early or late a customer makes payments relative to the due date.
Example:
• Previously paid 10 days before due date.
• Now pays exactly on due date or slightly late.
Interpretation: This indicates tightening liquidity even if payments are still technically
on time.
6. Payment Compression
Definition: A gradual shift from full payment to near-full payment to minimum payment.
Interpretation:
• The customer is not yet delinquent.
• Financial stress is increasing.
Detecting this early allows for low-cost interventions before default risk escalates.

C. Credit Utilization Dynamics
Static utilization levels are less informative than how utilization changes over time.
7. Utilization Slope
Definition: The rate at which credit utilization is increasing.
Example:
• Gradual increase from 30% to 40%.
• One-time spike to 70% followed by normalization.
3

Interpretation:
• A steady climb suggests structural stress.
• A one-off spike suggests a temporary event.
The slope is often more predictive than the level.
8. Balance Persistence
Definition: How long elevated balances remain outstanding.
Interpretation:
• Persistent balances indicate revolving behavior.
• Short-lived balances indicate controlled borrowing.

D. App and Digital Behavior
Digital interaction patterns provide insight into financial awareness and intent.
9. Statement-Day Engagement
Definition: Whether the customer opens the app around statement generation.
Interpretation:
• High engagement suggests awareness and control.
• Avoidance correlates with higher default risk.
10. Feature Exploration
Definition: Interaction with features such as payment options, installment simulations, or
credit limit views.
Interpretation:
• Indicates planning and financial engagement.
• Correlates with lower surprise risk.

E. Identity and Stability Signals
11. Device Stability
Definition: Frequency of device changes or consistent device usage.
Interpretation:
• Stable device usage indicates lower fraud and credit risk.
• High churn increases uncertainty.

4

12. Geographic Consistency
Definition: Transactions clustered in predictable locations.
Interpretation:
• Indicates local stability and predictable lifestyle patterns.

Closing Note for Part I
These low-hanging features already allow underwriting based on behavior rather than history.
They are explainable, regulator-friendly, and effective even when traditional credit data is limited.
Part II will extend this framework to partnership-driven alternative data (open banking, telecom, utilities, merchant platforms) and explain how these features integrate into short-horizon
underwriting models.

2. Features Requiring Future Partnerships (High-Impact Signals)
While the features described in Part I are sufficient to build a strong underwriting foundation,
the long-term competitive advantage comes from incorporating consented, ecosystem-level
alternative data. These features are not required on day one, but they significantly improve
approval accuracy, credit limit sizing, and early-risk detection once partnerships mature.
Importantly, these signals are most valuable for:
• thin-file or new-to-credit customers,
• early-stage portfolio expansion, and
• preventing non-performing loans through early detection.

A. Open Banking and Bank Account Data
Open banking data provides direct visibility into cash-flow reality, which no credit bureau score
can fully capture.
13. Salary Periodicity Confidence
Definition: The regularity and predictability of income deposits into a bank account.
Example:
• Monthly salary of similar amount from the same source.
• Irregular deposits of varying size and timing.
Interpretation:
• High periodicity implies stable repayment capacity.
• Irregular income requires tighter credit controls.
In practice, salary periodicity is often more informative than stated income.
5

14. Post-Essentials Cash Surplus
Definition: Income remaining after recurring essential expenses.
Interpretation:
• Captures true affordability.
• Supports safe credit limit sizing.
Two customers with identical income may have radically different surplus, and therefore
radically different risk profiles.
15. Low-Balance and Overdraft Frequency
Definition: How often bank balances approach zero or enter overdraft.
Interpretation:
• Frequent low balances indicate fragile liquidity.
• Such customers are more sensitive to shocks.
This feature is especially powerful for short-horizon (30–90 day) risk prediction.

B. Telecom and Utility Data (With Explicit Consent)
Telecom and utility data are among the strongest alternative signals globally, particularly for
customers with limited formal credit history.
16. Bill Payment Regularity
Definition: On-time versus late payments for telecom or utility bills.
Interpretation:
• Reflects habitual financial discipline.
• Strong predictor of credit repayment behavior.
These signals are particularly effective for first-time borrowers.
17. Tenure Stability
Definition: Length of time a customer has maintained the same phone number or utility
account.
Interpretation:
• Longer tenure indicates social and economic rootedness.
• Short tenure may reflect instability or recent disruption.
This feature also complements fraud prevention efforts.
—

C. Merchant and Platform Partnerships
Large merchants and platforms hold behavioral data that is highly predictive when used responsibly.
18. Refund and Dispute Frequency
Definition: Frequency of transaction reversals, refunds, or disputes.
Interpretation:
• High rates may indicate poor financial planning or stress.
• In some cases, elevated fraud risk.
This signal often correlates with unstable spending behavior.
19. Subscription Stack Density
Definition: Number of recurring subscription commitments.
Interpretation:
• High fixed obligations reduce financial flexibility.
• Important for affordability assessment.
Subscriptions behave like hidden fixed expenses.
20. Employer-Linked Spend Alignment
Definition: Spending patterns aligned with known salary cycles or employer payment schedules.
Interpretation:
• Indicates predictable cash-flow rhythm.
• Reduces uncertainty in repayment timing.
—

D. Network, Social, and Ecosystem-Derived Signals
Beyond individual behavior, credit risk is often influenced by a customer’s position within
broader economic and social networks. These features capture second-order effects that are
difficult to fake and slow to change.
21. Peer Stability Index
Definition: An aggregated stability measure derived from the behavior of customers with
similar transaction and merchant patterns.
Interpretation:
• Customers embedded in stable peer groups tend to remain stable.

7

• Sudden divergence from peer behavior can indicate emerging stress.
This feature does not require explicit social data; it emerges naturally from transaction
similarity graphs.
22. Merchant Network Health
Definition: The financial health of the merchant ecosystem a customer interacts with, inferred
from aggregate transaction trends.
Interpretation:
• Customers concentrated in declining merchant clusters may face indirect income risk.
• Exposure to resilient merchant networks correlates with lower default rates.
This captures economic context without requiring employer-level data.
—

E. Temporal and Shock-Response Features
These features measure how customers respond to stress, rather than whether stress exists.
23. Spend Shock Absorption Capacity
Definition: The ability of a customer to absorb unexpected large expenses without persistent
balance deterioration.
Example:
• Large medical or travel expense followed by normalization.
• Large expense followed by sustained minimum payments.
Interpretation:
• High absorption capacity indicates financial resilience.
• Low capacity suggests fragility even if income appears adequate.
This feature distinguishes temporary stress from structural weakness.
24. Recovery Velocity
Definition: The speed with which utilization and payment behavior return to baseline after a
disruption.
Interpretation:
• Fast recovery implies adaptability.
• Slow recovery increases probability of long-term delinquency.
Recovery velocity is often more predictive than the size of the initial shock.

F. Behavioral Consistency and Predictability
Predictability itself is a form of creditworthiness.
25. Behavioral Entropy
Definition: A measure of randomness in spending, payment, and engagement patterns over
time.
Interpretation:
• Low entropy reflects structured, planned behavior.
• High entropy correlates with higher operational and credit risk.
This feature captures instability that is not visible in averages.
26. Habit Formation Strength
Definition: The degree to which spending and payment behaviors repeat on predictable schedules.
Interpretation:
• Strong habits indicate lower surprise risk.
• Weak habits imply sensitivity to external shocks.
Habit strength is particularly useful for early-stage customers.
—

G. Forward-Looking Exposure Signals
These features anticipate future stress rather than reacting to past behavior.
27. Commitment Load Projection
Definition: Projected fixed obligations based on observed subscription growth, installment
adoption, and recurring payments.
Interpretation:
• Rising commitment load reduces future flexibility.
• Important for proactive credit limit management.
This treats commitments as future liabilities, not current ones.
28. Credit Elasticity Under Stress
Definition: Observed change in spending behavior when available credit tightens slightly.
Interpretation:
• Elastic response suggests discretionary usage.
• Inelastic response suggests dependence on credit.
This feature is invaluable for distinguishing healthy revolvers from distressed borrowers.

Why These Advanced Features Matter
These additional features:
• are difficult to manipulate,
• evolve slowly over time,
• capture resilience rather than snapshots,
• and allow risk management to be proactive rather than reactive.

Final Strategic Insight
The most dangerous credit risk is not low income or high utilization. It is fragility
— the inability to absorb shocks and recover.

H. Non-Transactional Alternative Data Signals
Transaction data is powerful, but it reflects behavior after money is spent. The strongest
underwriting systems complement it with alternative data that captures stability, obligations,
intent, and resilience outside the card itself.
These signals are especially valuable for thin-file customers and early-stage portfolios.
29. Income Source Concentration
Definition: The number and consistency of income sources inferred from bank inflows or
employer-linked payments.
Interpretation:
• Single, stable income source implies predictability.
• Multiple volatile sources increase uncertainty.
This feature helps distinguish diversified resilience from income instability.
—
30. Income Volatility Index
Definition: Variance of income inflows over time, normalized by mean income.
Interpretation:
• Low volatility supports higher safe credit limits.
• High volatility necessitates tighter exposure control.
Income volatility is often more informative than income level.
—

10

31. Fixed Obligation Burden
Definition: Share of income pre-committed to fixed obligations such as rent, utilities, telecom,
insurance, or loan EMIs.
Interpretation:
• High fixed burden reduces flexibility under stress.
• Low burden increases shock absorption capacity.
This is a forward-looking affordability signal rather than a backward-looking one.
—
32. Rent and Housing Stability Proxy
Definition: Consistency of housing-related payments or address tenure inferred from utilities
or banking data.
Interpretation:
• Stable housing correlates strongly with lower default risk.
• Frequent changes indicate disruption or transition.
Housing stability is one of the strongest predictors of long-term financial health globally.
—
33. Telecom Usage Stability
Definition: Continuity of mobile number usage, plan type consistency, and payment regularity.
Interpretation:
• Long-tenure numbers with consistent plans indicate rootedness.
• Frequent churn correlates with instability and higher risk.
Telecom data is particularly valuable for customers with limited formal credit history.
—
34. Digital Identity Continuity
Definition: Consistency across identity-linked digital touchpoints (devices, accounts, authentication patterns).
Interpretation:
• High continuity indicates low impersonation and fraud risk.
• Fragmentation increases both fraud and credit uncertainty.
This feature strengthens underwriting and fraud models simultaneously.
—

11

35. Employment Sector Risk Proxy
Definition: Exposure to economic sectors with differing volatility, inferred from employerlinked inflows or merchant clusters.
Interpretation:
• Employment in stable sectors implies smoother income.
• Cyclical sectors require conservative limit management.
This allows macro-aware underwriting without explicit employer data.
—
36. Life-Event Transition Indicators
Definition: Patterns suggesting major life transitions such as relocation, job change, or household formation.
Examples:
• Sudden geography shift.
• Temporary income interruption followed by normalization.
Interpretation:
• Transitions increase short-term risk.
• But successful stabilization afterward is a strong positive signal.
These features help distinguish transient stress from chronic fragility.
—
37. Financial Planning Intent Signals
Definition: Explicit or implicit signals of planning intent, such as budgeting tool usage or
proactive data sharing.
Interpretation:
• Planning intent correlates with lower delinquency.
• Avoidance correlates with surprise defaults.
Intent-based signals often precede behavioral changes.
—

I. Why Alternative Data Complements Transactions
Transaction data answers:
“What has the customer already done?”
Alternative data answers:
“What constraints, obligations, and stability does the customer live with?”
12

Together, they allow underwriting models to:
• separate capacity from behavior,
• identify fragility before delinquency,
• and safely extend credit to customers who would otherwise be excluded.

Extended Executive Insight
Transactions show taste. Alternative data shows resilience. Good underwriting
needs both.

How These Features Are Used in Models
Despite the richness of these signals, the modeling approach remains deliberately simple and
robust.

Modeling Philosophy
• Start with explainable models (logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees).
• Focus on short-horizon risk (30–90 days), not lifetime prediction.
• Update predictions continuously as new behavior arrives.
The sophistication lies in feature design and monitoring, not black-box complexity.

Living Underwriting Score
All features feed into a dynamic internal score that:
• updates as behavior changes,
• supports dynamic credit limit management,
• enables early intervention before delinquency.
This score is designed to complement, not replace, external bureau data.
—

Why This Matters Strategically
Together, low-hanging and partnership-driven features allows the issuer to:
• approve more customers safely,
• size credit limits more accurately,
• reduce non-performing loans,
• and build trust with regulators through explainability.
Most importantly, underwriting becomes a learning system rather than a one-time gate.
13

Executive Summary
Good underwriting is not about predicting default perfectly. It is about understanding stability, regularity, and early stress — and responding before problems
escalate.
